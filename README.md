## With Caldera having a vast native token pool, I recommend choosing Ethereum as the best option for native token selection for rollups, given its advantages. For the layer you'll be sending the data to, I suggest opting for Celestia due to its speed and cost-effectiveness. If security is your primary concern, Ethereum can be preferred.

## You can use this section to make changes, adjustments, and to form a team for managing the rollup, expanding your organization's capabilities.

## If prices haven't dropped further, the cost of getting a mainnet service was just a bit less than $3000. In the future, buying a rollup from Caldera will be much simpler than buying and setting up a website after selling a domain. As time goes on, Caldera will become an increasingly cost-effective structure, offering a wide range of pricing orientations to users.


## Let me give you a great example of Caldera's future. Imagine you want to establish a shopping blockchain. Eventually, by setting up your shopping site as a rollup, you'll gain access to tremendous output data control, data provision, and robust economic management, all with speed and efficiency. Caldera will offer you the opportunity to be part of such a structure in the future.
